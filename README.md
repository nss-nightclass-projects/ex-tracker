# The Ex-Tracker

## Setup

**Your project should have:**
```
|- db
    |- locations.json
    |- ex.json
|- javascripts
    |- dom.js [Writing to the dom]
    |- events.js [Attaching all event listeners]
    |- data.js [Error and success functions for AJAX call]
    |- main.js [Entry point/start application]
    |- locations.js [AJAX call for locations.json]
    |- ex.js [AJAX call for ex.json]
|- index.html
|- main.css
```
You can get more complex with the JavaScripts modules as needed.

**Install via CDN:**

- jQuery
- Bootstrap

**Browserify and Grunt:**

- Use npm to install Browserify, and any other packages you need to compile your modules.
- Make sure you have the Grunt task running that will build the distribution bundle file.
